Future development:
--Add Sort by Categories button.
--Add buttons for user to save and view other users they like dealing with. "Favorite traders" or "Straight-shooters" button or something like that.
--Add buttons for user to save and view items of interest. Similar to the "Wishlist" or the "Love" button you see on a lot of e-commerce sites.
-Items are automatically deleted from the wishlist when traded or removed.
